# USF-CS212-SoftwareDevelopment

## Overview
This course gave me experience in designing, implementing, testing, and debugging a large program. I was able to get advanced Java programming experience; covering topics such as: inheritance, multithreading, networking, database programming, and web development.

There was an emphasis on code qualityâ€”it is not enough to achieve correct results. Each project must pass several functionality tests and then undergo a rigorous code review checking for specific criteria, such as proper encapsulation and generalization, efficiency, and maintainability.
